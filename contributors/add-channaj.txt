Step: Create a new file

Back to the text editor:

Create a new file named "add-<USERNAME>.txt", where 'username' is your username. For instance, "add-jlord.txt".
Then, just write your GitHub username in it, that's it and that's all. For instance, I'd type 'jlord'.
Save this file in the 'contributors' folder in Patchwork: Patchwork/contributors/add-yourusername.txt
Next, check in your changes!
