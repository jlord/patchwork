### NOTICE

When you complete Git-it your name is added to the long list of others who have completed it at [jlord.us/patchwork](http://jlord.us/patchwork) (this repository's site). Recently the site became too large to edit with the regular GitHub API so it is currently not being upated. **Git-it it still works and you can complete all the challenges**, you just won't see your name on the site right now until I update things. I'll try and get to it soon :sparkles:.

If you want to help update @reporobot to use the [Git Data API](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/), mosey over to [jlord/reporobot](https://github.com/jlord/reporobot/blob/master/buildpage.js).

# Patchwork

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlord/patchwork/gh-pages/patchwork-ss.png)

This repository is a website hosted by [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). It goes along with [Git-it](http://www.github.com/jlord/git-it), a terminal based workshop for learning Git and GitHub.

Users fork this repository and learn things like (forking) branching, adding collaborators, pulling in changes, pushing to a remote branch and submitting pull request. Once their pull request comes in, @reporobot rewrites the index.html here to include the user.

#### So much social coding goodness! :octocat:
