hello there
do you know what time it is???

Notes from the Assignment

1) CLONE this repository to your Desktop
*To get a forked repository (lives remotely on YOUR GITHUB), you must clone it

2) CREATE a branch off of master with a descriptive name (ideally including your initials)

3) WORK in your branch! not on master

4) MODIFY the group_info.md to add your profile section (see template below)

5) PUSH your changes back to GitHub (don't merge into master locally!)

6) ON GITHUB, file a new pull request to propose a merge of your branch into base: master and suggest one of your peers as a reviewer so they get notified (see this not 100% applicable but still useful video tutorial 1:24+ if you're stuck)

7) MAKE SURE to resolve merge conflicts if there are any (GitHub interface for this is good you can do this online, see this useful video tutorial 9:00+ if you're stuck)

8) DO NOT merge your pull request until your reviewer has given you the go ahead (reviewers: make sure to react to pull request notifications, look over the proposed merge and leave comment)

9) ONCE reviewer has given go ahead, complete your merge

10) SYNCHRONIZE back with your desktop and check that the master branch has your updates
